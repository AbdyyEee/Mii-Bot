**Contrubuting is extremly simple, and does not require any knowledge of Python.**

I've built a script to make contrbution easier. This is done by having the script auto-generate the code once the fields are inputed.

To use this script, download "Mii Generator.exe", and follow the instructions on the command line. 

Once that is done, create a pull request with the "{mii name}.py" file that was generated added to the "cmds" folder. 

**Keep in mind the script is not perfect, errors can occur. I will probably catch these errors in the pull request.**
